## Sagemaker HyperPod Checkpointless Training

Checkpointless training on Amazon SageMaker HyperPod enables recovery from training infrastructure failures in minutes. Examples in this repository help you get started with training and fine-tuning NeMo-supported models on Kubernetes with GPU.

Amazon SageMaker HyperPod Checkpointless Training is built on top of the NVIDIA NeMo framework. You can run recipes within SageMaker HyperPod. If you're familiar with using NeMo, the process of using the checkpointless training is the same. With some changes, you can start training a model checkpointlessly.
